Flesh out your project plan by creating:
## WireFrame
A wireframe for each page in the MVP of your project, at least 3 total. These can be hand-drawn wireframes that you have photographed using your smartphone or they can be PDF or image exports from a tool like Moqups or Google Drawings. Regardless of how you create them, your wireframes should be clear and readable and they should be added as files within your Git repository. Be sure to submit following the formatting directives in the README, which includes adding your images to your repo, along with links to them within the README. Consult GitHub’s markdown reference as necessary.

## Public Project Tracker
A link to your public project tracker (i.e. Trello). As part of the setup for this class, you created a project tracker and a project. Make sure you have added your MVP user stories and moved your initial stories into the “Next” column. Your stories should be clear and formatted as proper user stories and not just tasks.

## Link to Project Repository
Create your initial project repository in GitHub. Don’t worry, you can always rename this later. Link this in the above README as well.
